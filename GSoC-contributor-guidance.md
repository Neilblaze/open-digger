# Contributor Guidance for GSoC 2025

## General guidelines üìú

* Read the [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) written by the Google Summer of Code organizers.
* Go through the [GSoC 2025 Project Ideas List](https://open-digger.cn/en/docs/activity_docs/gsoc25#project-ideas-) for OpenDigger and read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-digger-website/blob/master/GSoC-contributor-guidance.md).
* Understand the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), application process, and the project you are applying for, assuming best intentions throughout the period.
* Join our [Slack](http://opendigger.slack.com) and introduce yourself in the `#general` and `#gsoc` text-channel.
* Ask for any development-related help in the `#opendigger` channel and direct all your GSoC related queries to the `#gsoc` channel on Slack.
* Start as early as possible and try to submit at least a few good code contributions to any project of your liking from [here](https://open-digger.cn/en/docs/activity_docs/gsoc25#project-ideas-) before submitting your proposal, so that we can be sure that you have what it takes to be a good OpenDigger contributor.
* Other forms of contributions like helping out on Slack, GitHub issues, and reviewing pull requests are also most welcomed. We'd prefer contributors who can not only contribute to the codebase of OpenDigger but can also contribute to the community around it.
* Make sure to reach out and interact with the mentors to discuss your solution and approach towards a project idea before starting to fill in the proposal.
* Share the first draft of your proposal as early as possible.
* Share the proposal link as text, markdown, or preferably [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) (with comment-enabled) or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
* Final proposals should be submitted on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline and after all the reviews have been done.

## Starting out with OpenDigger üå±

* First and foremost, try to fork, clone, and setup the [OpenDigger](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-digger-website) repository (or any other project you wish to work on) locally.
* For most projects, you just need to follow the associated [`README`](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-digger-website/blob/master/README.md) file to set them up locally.
* If working on the main OpenDigger project, please visit the [official website](https://open-digger.cn/) to get familiar with how the documentation is structured, which will help you later to find your answers more quickly.
* Non-code contributions (issue triaging, PR reviews, Slack assistance) are equally valued :)

## Picking up and working on issues üõ†Ô∏è

* Please feel free to pick up any [`gsoc-25`](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-digger-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Agsoc-25) tagged issues from the various OpenDigger repositories.
* Or, if you feel confident enough, you are welcome to help out with other non-labelled issues as well, but we'd suggest you to start with an easy issue.
* Always open __Draft__ PR and make sure to test your changes thoroughly in your local environment before marking your PR as ready for review. If you face any issues or don't understand something, feel free to reach out on Slack and ask for help.
* In order to handle the inflow of too many potential contributors and ensure timely resolution of the issues, we will only be assigning issues to contributors once they've looked into the issue and suggested a potential solution on the GitHub issue itself.
* While this might feel like it would lead to a lot of contributors wasting their time on an issue while only one of them will be able to create a final PR, please remember that we'll also be considering the quality of reviews a contributor leaves on other contributors' PRs while reviewing the final proposal, and investigating the issue yourself will help you post good PR reviews. __But please refrain from spamming the PRs with reviews, only good and quality reviews will be considered.__
* Moreover, in this process, you'll also get to explore and get familiar with the codebase of OpenDigger, which would help you with further issues.
* But still if you feel like you are leaving good reviews on other contributors' PRs but not getting to solve any issues on your own due to the speed at which others come up with the solution, please reach out to us on Slack and we'll help find a suitable issue for you.

## Writing your proposal üìù

* Your proposal should contain a clear understanding on how you're going to approach the project idea, along with a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it.
* If you plan to propose your own project idea, please include a project outline, goals (as done in [Ideas List](https://open-digger.cn/en/docs/activity_docs/gsoc25#project-ideas-)), and a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it.
